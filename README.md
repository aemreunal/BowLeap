BowLeap
=======

I created this simple bowling game as a "getting started" project for Unity and the Leap Motion controller. 
The project took me about one week to complete (I only worked during days). To correctly build & run the game, the 
Leap Motion libraries (meaning, the Unity plugins) are required. Basic keyboard controls are also available 
inside the "Player" script (which governs all the user interaction).

Note 1: To use plugins with Unity, you will need a Pro licence (I used the 30-day pro trial).

Note 2: If you do use the code as a basis for your project or just learn from it, please give me a shout out 
and a line on your projects' credits. :)
